Problem Set 4

ISOC
The Internet Society (ISOC) is an organization founded in 1992 by two of the “fathers of the internet,” Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. It was created to improve the world with increasing access to the internet, connecting people worldwide, and collaborating with different individuals and groups, and today its mission is to shape the future of the internet as billions of more people get online.

ISOC currently has more than 65,000 members throughout the world, with 145 people running the organization, and it is governed by a Board of Trustees. Trustees typically have three-year terms, and the current president and CEO of the organization is Kathryn Brown from the United States, who previously worked at Verizon and in the Clinton administration. ISOC is guided by values like communication, education, innovation, technological advancement, and productivity.

1,140 * 900 = 1,296,000 pixels
1,296,000 * 16 = 20,736,000 bits
20,736,000/0.01 = 2,073,600,000 bits per second = 2.07 Gbps
The minimal necessary line speed to meet the goal is about 2.07 Gbps.

7.6
a.	Assuming 500,000 characters per book:
500,000 * 1,000,000 = 500,000,000,000 characters = 500,000,000,000 bytes
The order of magnitude for the bytes of data for all of the books is 11.
b.	At 10 Mbps:
500,000,000,000 * 8 / 10^6 = 4,000,000 Megabits
4,000,000 / 10 = 400,000 seconds = 4.63 days
It would take 4.63 days to transmit the entire collection of books with the original Ethernet line.
At 1 Gbps:
500,000,000,000 * 8 / 10^9 = 4,000 Gigabits
4,000 / 1 = 4,000 seconds = 1.11 hours
It would take 1.11 hours with a line with a 1 Gbps speed.

7.11
a.	N point-to-point communication links
b.	Store-and-forward network

7.16
a.	5 simple paths
b.	Shortest path from node A to node G
A		0	X	X	X	X	X	X
B	(A)	inf	5	5	X	X	X	X
C	(E)	inf	inf	inf	9	9	8	X
D	(A)	inf	6	6	6	X	X	X
E	(B)	inf	inf	inf	7	7	X	X
F	(A)	inf	3	X	X	X	X	X
G	(C)	inf	inf	11	11	11	11	10
A -> B -> E -> C -> G or A -> D -> E -> C -> G is the shortest path from node A to node G, with an overall delay of 10.
c.	Shortest path from node A to node G if node E fails
A		0	X	X	X	X	X
B	(A)	inf	5	5	X	X	X
C	(B)	inf	inf	inf	9	9	X
D	(A)	inf	6	6	6	X	X
F	(A)	inf	3	X	X	X	X
G	(F)	inf	inf	11	11	11	11
The shortest path does change if node E fails, and it becomes either A -> F -> G, A -> B -> C -> G, or A -> D -> C -> G, with an overall delay of 11.
