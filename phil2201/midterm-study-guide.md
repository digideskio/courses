##DESCARTES

###*Discourse on Method*

####Part I
- Every person is, more or less, equally endowed with reason
  - Humans are all rational animals and only differ in their accidental/non-essential properties
  - People hold different beliefs not because they have different levels of reason, but because “we lead our thoughts among different paths and do not take the same things into consideration"
- Descartes ended his studies because he felt that subjects like mathematics and philosophy were ultimately unsatisfying

####Part II
- He learned to distrust what he had learned in favor of reason above all else
  - A person is best served by the guidance of reason alone, not the opinions and desires of others
  - Descartes released all of his preconceived notions and rebuilt his ideas of the world using his own reason
- Four laws dictate Descartes’ inquiry
  - Do not accept anything as true unless it is evident (to prevent hasty conclusions)
  - Divide any problem into the greatest possible number of parts to analyze separately
  - Start from the simplest objects and progress slowly toward more difficult targets of study
  - Constantly review progress to ensure that no facts or information have been excluded or incorrectly applied

####Part V
- Descartes focuses on the nature of light and human beings as perceivers of light
- He posits an imaginary world created by God as a random chaos of matter governed by laws of nature
  - The laws of nature follow from God’s perfection and so must be the same in any world
- Our rational selves are a gift from God, as they can’t be explained by laws of nature
  - Animals have no intelligence and are governed by instinct
  - Humans, as a result, are different and have immortal souls

####Part VI
- By positing God as the first cause of everything and using his method, Descartes has provided a blueprint that other figures in science, mathematics, and more can use to further study
  - Even people with the best minds can benefit from his work
  - However, people who want to appear knowledge and are unwilling to admit ignorance will not

###*Meditations*

####First Meditation
- We must start from the foundations to build knowledge on certain grounds
  - The Meditator reasons that we only need some reason to doubt his current opinions to begin searching for a better foundation for knowledge
- What we can accept as most true is what we know from our senses—even when the senses deceive (i.e., perception of size from a distance, etc.)
  - The important case where that isn’t true is dreaming, since we are wholly convinced by our senses
  - The Meditator argues that even dreams are drawn from waking experiences
    - Though we can doubt composite things, we cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed (size, shape, time, etc.)
- However, even the simplest things can be doubted if God is a deceiver
  - One argument might be that God is supremely good and would not deceive us
    - Descartes disagrees; by that reasoning, God would never deceive us of anything, and that’s not the case
  - If we suppose there is no God, then there is an even greater likelihood that we are being deceived, since our senses aren’t created by a perfect being
- The Meditator then supposes that an evil demon is deceiving him, so he must doubt everything

####Second Meditation
- The cogito argument (“cogito ergo sum”)
  - The Meditator seeks to establish one certainty
    - If his senses are faulty, his memory is mistaken, and all of his present opinions are untrustworthy, perhaps the only certainty is that nothing is certain
  - However, then his own existence is called into question—without certainty of the physical world, how can he be certain he exists?
    - The cogito argument concludes that “I am, I exist” must be true whenever it is thought in his mind—the Meditator must exist to be misled by the evil demon
    - In that case, the Meditator, at his most basic level, is a thing that thinks, and that is the only certainty he can establish
      - He thinks, understands, and wills, but also imagines and senses
- The wax argument
  - The Meditator considers what he can know about a piece of wax from his senses: color, shape, size, texture, etc.
    - After the wax melts, the sensible qualities change (it becomes soft, not hard), but the same wax remains, so our knowledge of it cannot come from the senses
  - The Meditator can only know that the piece of wax is extended, flexible, and changeable
    - As a result, he knows the wax through intellect alone
    - The mind is a far better knower than the body
  - What we can’t doubt is the way we perceive the wax, though we can doubt that what we perceive is true

####Third Meditation
- The Meditator is certain that he is a thinking thing and that he clearly and distinctly perceives that fact
  - Whatever he perceives clearly and distinctly must be certain
- Thoughts fall into two categories: ideas and volitions/emotions/judgments
  - He cannot be mistaken about ideas or volitions and emotions; judgments are the area of error
  - The most common error in judgment is to judge that the ideas in one’s mind conform to things outside the mind
    - Three sources of ideas
      - Innate
      - Adventitious (coming from outside of us)
      - Invented by us
- Ideas are mere modes of thought and all equal in their level of formal reality
  - What they represent differs, so their objective reality differs, too
- The Meditator believes that no effect can have more reality than its cause
  - The idea of God must have far more objective reality than the Meditator has formal reality
    - God is an infinite substance, while he is a finite substance
    - Since the idea of God could not have originated in himself, he concludes that God must be the cause and therefore must exist
  - If an imperfect being created the Meditator, he/she would have had to endow him with the idea of God, and we have infinite regress (which much lead back to the idea of God coming from God)
  - The idea of God is innate—the Meditator clearly and distinctly perceives that God is not a deceiver, since a perfect God has no defects

####Fourth Meditation
- Now that the Meditator knows that God exists, he can build upon that idea
  - God would not deceive him because God is perfect
  - If he is a creation of God, his judgment must be perfect as long as it’s used properly
    - However, if that’s true, how can the Meditator make mistakes?
      - He is between God (an infinite, perfect being) and nothingness, and he participates in both forms
      - Any mistakes or falsities from his judgment result from his participation in nothingness; God is the source of any perfection
- He is dissatisfied with the question of why God would not create perfect beings
  - God’s motives and reasons are unknowable to finite beings
  - Rather than looking at an isolated part of the universe (humans as imperfect beings), we should look for perfection in the universe overall
- The Meditator’s errors primarily depend upon the intellect and the will
  - The intellect only allows us to perceive ideas, not make judgments, so that cannot be the source of error
  - In freedom of will, the Meditator is closest to God, as he has virtually unlimited choice
    - God’s will is superior only in that God always has perfect knowledge and can will what is good
  - As a result, errors stem from the fact that the will has a much wider scope than understanding—not because either intellect or will is flawed
    - In all matters of the intellect except clear and distinct perceptions, there’s a level of uncertainty, and the appropriate reaction for “will” is to refrain from judgment

####Fifth Meditation
- There are abstract geometrical objects which do not exist in the material world, do not depend on the Meditator’s mind, and yet are not nothing
  - There are no triangles in the world, and yet they exist
  - Mathematical objects are more certain than objects of the senses
  - A triangle must have all the properties he ascribes to it because the triangle exists as an idea in his mind, and he clearly and distinctly perceives the properties

####Sixth Meditation
- The Meditator accepts the strong possibility that material objects exist because they are the subject matter of pure mathematics, which he perceives clearly and distinctly
  - Imagination cannot be an essential property of the mind because the mind could exist without it
    - The Meditator proposes that imagination is associated with the body, which would mean that the body exists
  - The other proposal comes from the senses—the Meditator perceives that he has a body that perceives
    - The perceptions can be reasonably traced to an outside source, as he cannot create his own perceptions
- Sensory perception is a passive faculty, and we are naturally inclined to believe that what we perceive comes from objects that resemble those perceptions

##SPINOZA

###*Ethics*

####Part I: Concerning God
1. Substance is by nature prior to its affections
1. Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common
1. When things have nothing in common, one cannot be the cause of the other
1. Two or more distinct things are distinguished from one another either by the difference of the attributes of the substances or by the difference of the affections of the substances
1. In the universe, there cannot be two or more substances of the same nature or attribute
1. One substance cannot be produced by another substance
1. Existence belongs to the nature of substance
1. Every substance is necessarily infinite
1. The more reality or being a thing has, the more attributes it has
1. Each attribute of one substance must be conceived through itself
1. God, or substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence, necessarily exists
1. No attribute of substance can be truly conceived from which it would follow that substance can be divided
1. Absolutely infinite substance is indivisible
1. There can be, or be conceived, no other substance but God
1. Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God
1. From the necessity of the divine nature, there must follow infinite things in infinite ways (modis)—that is, everything that can come from within the scope of infinite intellect
1. God acts solely from the laws of his own nature, constrained by none
1. God is the immanent, not the transitive, cause of all things
1. God is eternal—that is, all the attributes of God are eternal
1. God’s existence and his essence are one and the same
1. All things that follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of God must have existed always, and as infinite; that is, through the said attribute they are eternal and infinite
1. Whatever follows from some attribute of God, insofar as the attribute is modified by a modification that exists necessarily and as infinite through that same attribute, must also exist both necessarily and as infinite
1. Every mode which exists necessarily and as infinite must have necessarily followed either from the absolute nature of some attribute of God or from some attribute modified by a modification which exists necessarily and as infinite
1. The essence of things produced by God does not involve evidence
1. God is the efficient cause, not only of the existence of things, but also of their essence
1. A thing which has been determined to act in a particular way has necessarily been so determined by God; and a thing which has not been determined by God cannot determine itself to act
1. A thing which has been determined by God to act in a particular way cannot render itself undetermined
1. Every individual thing, i.e., anything whatever which is finite and has a determinate existence, cannot exist or be determined to act unless it be determined to exist and to act by another cause which is also finite and has a determinate existence, and this cause again cannot exist or be determined to act unless it be determined to exist and to act by another cause which is also finite and has a determine existence, and so ad infinitum
1. Nothing in nature is contingent, but all things are from the necessity of the divine nature determined to exist and to act in a definite way
1. The finite intellect in act or the infinite intellect in act must comprehend the attributes of God and the affections of God, and nothing else
1. The intellect in act, whether it be finite or infinite, as also will, desire, love, etc., must be related to Natura natural, not to Natura naturans
1. Will cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary cause
1. Things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case
1. God’s power is his very essence
1. Whatever we conceive to be within God’s power necessarily exists
1. Nothing exists from whose nature an effect does not follow

####Part II: Of the Nature and Origin of the Mind
1. Thought is an attribute of God; i.e., God is a thinking thing
1. Extension is an attribute of God; i.e., God is an extended thing
1. In God there is necessarily the idea both of his essence and of everything that necessarily follows from his essence
1. The idea of God, from which infinite things follow in infinite ways, must be one, and one only
1. The formal being of ideas recognizes God as its cause only insofar as he is considered as a thinking thing, and not insofar as he is explicated by any other attribute; that is, the ideas both of God’s attributes and of individual things recognize as their efficient cause not the things of which they are ideas, that is, the things perceived, but God himself insofar as he is a thinking thing
1. The modes of any attribute have God for their cause only insofar as he is considered under that attribute, and not insofar as he is considered under any other attribute
1. The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things
1. The ideas of nonexistent individual things or modes must be comprehended in the infinite idea of God in the same way as the formal essences of individual things or modes are contained in the attributes of God
1. The idea of an individual thing existing in actuality has God for its cause not insofar as he is infinite but insofar as he is considered as affected by another idea of a thing existing in actuality, of which God is the cause insofar as he is affected by a third idea, and so ad infinitum
1. The being of substance does not pertain to the essence of man; i.e., substance does not constitute the form of man
1. That which constitutes the actual being of the human mind is basically nothing else but the idea of an individual actually existing thing
1. Whatever happens in the object of the idea constituting the human mind is bound to be perceived by the human mind; i.e., the idea of that thing will necessarily be in the human mind
1. The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body—i.e., a definite mode of extension actually existing, and nothing else
1. The human mind is capable of perceiving a great many things, and this capacity will vary in proportion to the variety of states which its body can assume
1. The idea which constitutes the formal being of the human mind is not simple, but composed of very many ideas
1. The idea of any mode wherein the human mind is affected by external bodies must involve the nature of the human body together with the nature of the external body
1. If the human body is affected in a way that involves the nature of some external body, the human mind will regard that same external body as actually existing, or as present to itself, until the human body undergoes a further modification which excludes the existence or presence of the said body
1. If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same time, when the mind afterwards imagines one of them, it will straightway remember the others, too
1. The human mind has no knowledge of the body, nor does it know it to exist, except through ideas of the affections by which the body is affected
1. There is also in God the idea or knowledge of the human mind, and this follows in God and is related to God the same way as the idea or knowledge of the human body
1. This idea of the mind is united to the mind in the same way as the mind is united to the body
1. The human mind perceives not only the affections of the body but also the ideas of these affections
1. The mind does not know itself except insofar as it perceives ideas of affections of the body
1. The human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge of the component parts of the human body
1. The idea of any affection of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of an external body
1. The human mind does not perceive any external body as actually existing except through the ideas of affections of its own body
1. The idea of any affection of the human body does not involve adequate knowledge of the human body
1. The ideas of the affections of the human body, insofar as they are related only to the human mind, are not clear and distinct, but confused
1. The idea of the idea of any affection of the human body does not involve adequate knowledge of the human mind
1. We can have only a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body
1. We can have only a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of particular things external to us
1. All ideas are true insofar as they are related to God
1. There is nothing positive in ideas whereby they can be said to be false
1. Every idea which in us is absolute, that is, adequate and perfect, is true
1. Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge which inadequate ideas, that is, fragmentary and confused ideas, involve
1. Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity as adequate, or clear and distinct, ideas
1. That which is common to all things and is equally in the part as in the whole does not constitute the essence of any one particular thing
1. Those things that are common to all things and are equally in the part as in the whole can be conceived only adequately
1. Of that which is common and proper to the human body and to any external bodies by which the human body is customarily affected, and which is equally in the part as well as in the whole of any of these bodies, the idea also in the mind will be adequate
1. Whatever ideas follow in the mind from ideas that are adequate in it are also adequate
1. Knowledge of the first kind is the only cause of falsity; knowledge of the second and third kind is necessarily true
1. Knowledge of the second and third kind, and not knowledge of the first kind, teaches us to distinguish true from false
1. He who has a true idea knows at the same time that he has a true idea and cannot doubt its truth
1. It is not in the nature of reason to regard things as contingent, but as necessary
1. Every idea of any body or particular thing existing in actuality necessarily involves the eternal and infinite essence of God
1. The knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God which each idea involves is adequate and perfect
1. The human mind has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God
1. In the mind, there is no absolute, or free, will; the mind is determined to this or that volition by a cause, which is likewise determined by another cause, and this again by another, and so ad infinitum
1. There is in the mind no solution, that is, affirmation and negation, except that which an idea, insofar as it is an idea, involves

####Part V: Of the Power of the Intellect, or of Human Freedom
1. The mind can exercise neither imagination nor memory save while the body endures
1. Nevertheless, there is necessarily in God an idea which expresses the essence of this or that human body under a form of eternity
1. The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed along with body, but something of it remains, which is eternal
1. The more we understand particular things, the more we understand God
The highest conatus of the mind and its highest virtue is to understand things by the third kind of knowledge
1. The more capable the mind is of understanding things by the third kind of knowledge, the more it desires to understand things by this same kind of knowledge
1. From this third kind of knowledge there arises the highest possible contentment of mind
1. The conatus, or desire, to know things by the third kind of knowledge cannot arise from the first kind of knowledge, but from the second
1. Whatever the mind understands under a form of eternity it does not understand from the fact that it conceives the present actual existence of the body, but from the fact that it conceives the essence of the body under a form of eternity
1. Our mind, insofar as it knows both itself and the body under a form of eternity, necessarily has a knowledge of God, and knows that it is in God and is conceived through God
1. The third kind of knowledge depends on the mind as its formal cause insofar as the mind is eternal
1. We take pleasure in whatever we understand by the third kind of knowledge, and this is accompanied by the idea of God as its cause
1. The intellectual love of God which arises from the third kind of knowledge is eternal
1. It is only while the body endures that the mind is subject to passive emotions
1. God loves himself with an infinite intellectual love
1. The mind’s intellectual love toward God is the love of God wherewith God loves himself not insofar as he is infinite, but insofar as he can be explicated through the essence of the human mind considered under a form of eternity
1. There is nothing in Nature which is contrary to this intellectual love, or which can destroy it
The greater the number of things the mind understands by the second and third kinds of knowledge, the less subject it is to emotions that are bad, and the less it fears death
He whose body is capable of the greatest amount of activity has a mind whose greatest part is eternal
1. The more perfection a thing has, the more active and the less passive it is—conversely, the more active it is, the more perfect it is
1. Even if we did not know that our mind is eternal, we should still regard as being of prime importance piety and religion and, to sum up completely, everything which we showed to be related to courage and nobility
1. Blessedness is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself; we do not enjoy blessedness because we keep our lusts in check—on the contrary, it is because we enjoy blessedness that we are able to keep our lusts in check
